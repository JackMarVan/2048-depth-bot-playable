The program will ask for an amount of games to be played for both a random generator and a depth search generator, as well as a depth for the latter.
Depths of four or more will take a while to execute, with a depth of five taking about a minute, with further depths likely taking much longer. I do not
recommend exceeding five.

If you would like to manually play 2048, a playable version is included.
